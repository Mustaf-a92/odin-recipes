    <h3>Desserts, source of everyone's happiness I can assume.</h3>
    <p>Desserts would be a good choice to eat after a good healthy meal.</p>
    <p>Today, we'll be talking about Pancakes, some easy to prepare dessert and a delicious one.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Yoghurt diluted with milk.</li>
        <li>1 small spoon of Vanila liquid</li>
        <li>3 big spoons of sugar</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>1 big cup of flour</li>
        <li>1 big spoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>3 big spoons of oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And you're almost done!</p>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the ingredients, and mix until it becomes one liquid.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan on high heat for few seconds then lower it.</li>
        <li>Put small amout of the liquid and let it cook easily.</li>
        <li>Remove the Pancakes from the pan and put them on a serving dish.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>And what I like to do now, is to heat some chocolate on a bowl until it's fully liquid, 
        then just pour it evenly on the pancakes! It adds an amazing flavour.
    </h5>
